# 🚀 Running a React + Vite App Locally

Steps for running this react project in local machine.

---

## ✅ 1. Install Node.js
Make sure you have **Node.js v16+** installed.

Check your versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If Node.js is not installed, download it from the official website.

---

## ✅ 2. Clone the Repository

Use Git to clone the project:

```bash
https://github.com/Dipakxettri/ReactLearnings.git
```


---

## ✅ 3. Navigate Into the Project Folder

```bash
cd project
```
---

## ✅ 4. Install Dependencies

Install all required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

(or use `yarn` or `pnpm` if the project uses it)

---

## ✅ 5. Start the Development Server

Run the Vite dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see something like:

```
VITE vX.X.X  ready in Xs
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

---

## ✅ 6. Open the App in the Browser

Go to:

```
http://localhost:5173/
```

(or whichever URL Vite displays)

---

## ⚙️ Optional: Common Issues & Fixes

### ❌ Port Already in Use
Run the server on another port:

```bash
npm run dev -- --port=3000
```

### ❌ Dependencies Missing
Ensure all dependencies are installed:

```bash
npm install
```

### ❌ Node Version Too Old
Update Node.js to the latest LTS version.
